# Research

Ad-hoc research tool. Not part of the craft pipeline - use it whenever you want to understand something. Phase 1 produces comprehensive research most users never need to go beyond. Phase 2 is the optional "go deeper" layer.

## Project Root

Use `$CRAFT_PROJECT_ROOT` (set at session start) as the base path for all `.craft/` references. If not set, resolve by walking up from PWD to find the nearest `.craft/.global-state`.

Set `PROJECT` to `${CRAFT_PROJECT_ROOT:-.}`.

## Flow

### Step 0: Determine Invocation Mode

Parse args to determine routing:

**Mode A - New research query:** Args contain a natural language query (not a known topic slug or "continue").
→ Jump to **Step 2** (Discover).

**Mode B - Existing topic slug:** Args match an existing folder name in `$PROJECT/.craft/research/`.
→ Jump to **Step 1b** (Browse Topic).

**Mode C - "continue" keyword:** Args are exactly `continue`.
→ Jump to **Step 1c** (Resume).

**Mode D - Quick flags:** Args contain `--quick` or `--deep` or `--exhaustive` after the query.
→ Extract the query and depth flag. Jump to **Step 2** with depth preset.

**Mode E - No args:** Jump to **Step 1** (Dashboard).

### Step 1: Research Dashboard

List existing research topics and their status.

Use **Glob** with pattern `$PROJECT/.craft/research/*/_plan.md` to find all research topics.

For each topic found:
- Use **Read** with `limit: 20` to extract frontmatter (query, date, status, depth)
- Check staleness: if `stale_after` exists and is past today's date, mark as `STALE`
- Check for pending elaboration: look for branch files with `status: complete` in frontmatter vs branches in `_plan.md`

**If no research exists:**
> "No research yet. What would you like to research?"
>
> [Wait for user input, then jump to **Step 2**]

**If research exists:**

Use **AskUserQuestion**:
```
question: "You have [N] research topics. What would you like to do?"
header: "Research"
options:
  - label: "Start new research"
    description: "Research a new topic from scratch"
  - label: "Browse existing"
    description: "[list: topic1 (complete), topic2 (STALE), topic3 (depth 1 - can go deeper)]"
  - label: "Go deeper on existing"
    description: "Pick a topic and elaborate on specific branches"
    → only show if any topics have branch files eligible for Phase 2
```

**If "Start new research"** → Ask "What would you like to research?", then jump to **Step 2**.
**If "Browse existing"** → Jump to **Step 1b** with topic picker.
**If "Go deeper"** → Jump to **Step 1b** with intent to elaborate.
**If user provides custom text** → Treat as a new research query, jump to **Step 2**.

### Step 1b: Browse Topic

If multiple topics, use **AskUserQuestion** to pick one. If already selected (from Mode B), skip the picker.

Use **Read** to read the topic's `_plan.md`. Display the ranked overview to the user.

Use **AskUserQuestion**:
```
question: "What would you like to do with this research?"
header: "Topic"
options:
  - label: "Go deeper on a branch"
    description: "Pick a branch to elaborate further (Phase 2)"
  - label: "Verify findings"
    description: "Challenge claims against independent primary sources (runs /craft:research-verify)"
  - label: "Crystallize into an expert"
    description: "Create a reusable expert agent from this research"
  - label: "Re-research (refresh)"
    description: "This topic may be stale - run fresh research"
  - label: "Done browsing"
    description: "Back to what I was doing"
```

**If "Go deeper"** → Show ranked branches from `_plan.md`, let user pick one or more. Jump to **Step 4** (Deeper Research).
**If "Verify findings"** → Invoke `/craft:research-verify {topic-slug}`.
**If "Crystallize"** → Jump to **Step 6** (Crystallize Expert).
**If "Re-research"** → Jump to **Step 2** with the original query from the topic's frontmatter. Existing folder gets archived to `{slug}--archived-{date}/`.
**If "Done"** → End.
**If custom text** → Treat as clarification or new query in context of this topic.

### Step 1c: Resume In-Progress

Use **Glob** to find topics where `_plan.md` has `status: in-progress`.

If one topic → auto-select it. Check what phase it's in based on which files exist.
If multiple → use **AskUserQuestion** to pick which topic to continue.

Resume from where it left off - if branch files are missing, re-spawn those agents.

---

### Step 2: Discover (Phase 1) - The Main Research

**This is the primary research product.** Most users stop here. The output should be comprehensive and valuable on its own.

#### 2.1: Create Research Folder

Create `$PROJECT/.craft/research/{topic-slug}/` using Bash `mkdir -p`.

Write initial `_plan.md` stub with `status: in-progress`:

```markdown
---
query: "original query"
date: {today}
status: in-progress
depth: 1
stale_after: {today + 3 months}
---

# Research: {Topic}

> In progress - agents researching...
```

#### 2.2: Decompose and Dispatch

Break the query into 3-5 sub-questions that cover the topic from different angles. Use your own knowledge to decompose - no searching needed. Think about:
- What is X? (fundamentals)
- How does X work? (mechanics)
- What are the alternatives? (landscape)
- What are the trade-offs? (decision support)
- What do practitioners report? (real-world experience)
- What's the current state of the art? (freshness)

Not every query needs all angles. A focused query ("best auth library for Next.js") might need 3 sub-questions. A broad query ("how should we architect real-time sync") might need 5.

**Spawn one researcher agent per sub-question in parallel** via the Agent tool:

```
subagent_type: "craft:researcher"
description: "Research: {short branch name}"
prompt: |
  ## Your Assignment

  **Topic:** {full research topic}
  **Branch:** {branch name}
  **Question:** {specific sub-question}
  **Write findings to:** {$PROJECT/.craft/research/{topic-slug}/{NN}-{branch-slug}.md}

  Research this question thoroughly. Write your complete findings to the file path
  above. Return only your lightweight summary to me.
```

Assign branch numbers (01, 02, 03...) in the order you decomposed them. The orchestrator will re-rank after agents return.

**Launch ALL agents simultaneously.** Do not wait for one to finish before launching the next.

**If `--quick` flag was set:** Still spawn parallel agents, but add to each prompt: "Limit to 3-5 searches. Focus on the top 2-3 most authoritative sources. Be concise."

#### 2.3: Collect and Rank

As agents complete, collect their lightweight summaries. Each summary contains:
- Branch name and file path
- Self-assessed confidence score
- Source counts
- Conflict count
- Top 3 findings (one-liners)

**Skim each branch file header** using Read with `limit: 25` (frontmatter + summary section) to validate the agent's self-assessment.

**Rank branches** against each other based on:
- Relevance to the original query
- Confidence scores
- Richness of findings (source count, finding count)
- Convergence - if multiple branches found the same thing, that's HIGH confidence

**Note overlap as convergence.** If agents A and C both found the same key point, that's evidence it matters. Flag it in the plan.

#### 2.4: Write the Plan

Update `_plan.md` with the complete ranked research:

```markdown
---
query: "original query"
date: {today}
status: complete
depth: 1
confidence: {aggregate across branches}
branches: {count}
total_sources: {sum across branches}
conflicts: {total conflicts found}
stale_after: {today + 3 months}
---

# Research: {Topic}

> **TL;DR:** 3-5 sentence executive summary synthesizing across all branches.

## Convergence Points
{Findings that appeared in multiple branches independently - highest confidence items}
- {convergence point 1} - found in branches {N}, {M}
- {convergence point 2} - found in branches {N}, {P}

## Ranked Branches

### 1. [{Branch Name}]({NN}-{slug}.md) [confidence: 0.92]
{2-3 sentence summary of what this branch found}
**Top findings:** {agent's top 3 one-liners}
**Sources:** {count cited}

### 2. [{Branch Name}]({NN}-{slug}.md) [confidence: 0.78]
{2-3 sentence summary}
**Top findings:** {top 3}
**Sources:** {count}

### 3. [{Branch Name}]({NN}-{slug}.md) [confidence: 0.65]
...

(ALL branches listed - nothing filtered out. Lower-ranked branches still visible.)

## Conflicts
{If any agents found conflicting information, surface it here prominently.}
- {conflict 1} - See [{branch}]({file}) for details

## Open Questions
{Gaps identified across branches. What couldn't be answered.}
- {gap 1}
- {gap 2}

## All Sources

Full citation index with claim traceability: [_sources.md](_sources.md)

{Consolidated numbered list from all branches, deduplicated.}
1. [Title](url) - {type: docs | academic | blog | community | corporate}
2. ...
```

**Also write `_sources.md`** - the citation reference file:

```markdown
# Sources: {Topic}

> Back to [Research Plan](_plan.md)

> Consolidated citation index across all branches. Use this to trace any claim back to its source.

| ID | Title | URL | Type | Cited By | Claims Supported |
|----|-------|-----|------|----------|-----------------|
| S1 | {Title} | {url} | {academic/corporate/docs/blog/community} | [Branch 1](01-{slug}.md), [Branch 3](03-{slug}.md) | Finding 1, Finding 3 in Branch 1; Finding 2 in Branch 3 |
| S2 | {Title} | {url} | {type} | [Branch 2](02-{slug}.md) | Finding 1 |
| ... | | | | | |
```

Build this by reading the Sources section of each branch file. The "Claims Supported" column maps directly from the `Claims supported:` field in each branch's source entries. The "Cited By" column lists which branches referenced this URL (deduplicate by URL).

#### 2.5: Present Results

Display to the user:

> **Research complete: {Topic}**
>
> {TL;DR from plan}
>
> **Confidence:** {aggregate} | **Branches:** {N} | **Sources:** {total cited}
>
> {If convergence points exist:}
> **High confidence (multiple branches agree):**
> - {convergence point 1}
> - {convergence point 2}
>
> {If conflicts exist:}
> **Heads up - conflicts found:**
> - {conflict 1 summary}
>
> **Saved to:** `.craft/research/{topic-slug}/`

Then offer next steps:

Use **AskUserQuestion**:
```
question: "Research saved. What next?"
header: "Next"
options:
  - label: "Go deeper on specific branches"
    description: "Pick branches to elaborate further (Phase 2)"
  - label: "Crystallize into an expert"
    description: "Create a reusable expert agent from this research"
  - label: "Done"
    description: "Research is sufficient"
```

**If "Go deeper"** → Show ranked branches, let user pick. Jump to **Step 3**.
**If "Crystallize"** → Jump to **Step 6** (Crystallize Expert).
**If "Done"** → End.
**If custom text** → Interpret (e.g., "go deeper on 1 and 3", "actually research X too", "make me an expert from this").

---

### Step 3: Elaborate (Phase 2) - Go Deeper

**Optional depth layer.** User selected specific branches to elaborate on.

For each selected branch, spawn a **researcher agent**:

```
subagent_type: "craft:researcher"
description: "Deep dive: {branch name}"
prompt: |
  ## Your Assignment - Phase 2 (Go Deeper)

  **Topic:** {full research topic}
  **Branch:** {branch name}
  **Existing research file:** {path to existing branch file}
  **Write deeper findings to:** {path - see below for naming}

  Read the existing branch file first. Then research the GAPS, CONFLICTS, and
  AREAS THAT NEED MORE DEPTH. Do not re-research what's already well-covered.

  Focus on:
  - Resolving any conflicts noted in the existing file
  - Filling gaps noted in "Open Questions"
  - Finding primary sources for claims marked LOW confidence
  - Practitioner experience and edge cases
```

**Phase 2 file naming:** The deeper findings get written alongside the original:
- If elaborating branch `02-depth-control.md`, the deeper file goes to `02-depth-control--deep.md`
- If going EVEN deeper later, the branch graduates to a folder (Step 4 pattern)

**After agents complete**, update `_plan.md`:
- Add a "Phase 2" section noting which branches were elaborated
- Update confidence scores if they changed
- Update conflicts section if any were resolved
- Note new findings in the branch summaries

Present updated results to user with same format as Step 2.5.

---

### Step 4: Deeper Research (Graduate to Folder)

When a branch has both its original file AND a `--deep` file and the user wants to go EVEN deeper:

#### 4.1: Graduate File to Folder

Save existing `02-depth-control.md` content.
Create `02-depth-control/` folder.
Move original to `02-depth-control/README.md` (becomes the parent synthesis).
Move `02-depth-control--deep.md` into the folder as well.

#### 4.2: Decompose for Deeper Discovery

Based on the branch's findings, conflicts, and gaps, generate 2-5 deeper sub-questions. These should drill into specifics, not re-cover what's already known.

#### 4.3: Spawn and Elaborate

Same pattern as Step 2 but scoped to this branch's sub-questions. Agents write to `02-depth-control/01-{sub-slug}.md`, etc.

#### 4.4: Update Parent

Update `02-depth-control/README.md` with the deeper findings synthesis.
Update the top-level `_plan.md` to note that branch 02 has been expanded with a link to the subfolder.

---

### Step 6: Crystallize Expert (Optional)

**This step creates a reusable expert agent from the research.** The expert is a `.claude/agents/` file that any session on this project can invoke.

#### 6.1: Load Full Research (MANDATORY - DO NOT SKIP)

**STOP. You have NOT read the research yet.** Up to this point you have only seen agent summaries and branch file headers. That is NOT enough to crystallize an expert. You MUST read every branch file in full before writing anything.

Use **Glob** to find all branch files: `$PROJECT/.craft/research/{topic-slug}/[0-9]*.md`

**Read EVERY branch file completely using the Read tool.** Also read `_plan.md` in full. Also read any `--deep` files and verification files if they exist.

**Do not proceed to Step 6.2 until you have called Read on every single file.** The expert will be shallow and wrong if you skip this. This has happened before - twice - and produced bad experts. Read everything.

#### 6.2: Read the Crystallize Template

Use **Read** to read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/commands/references/crystallize-expert.md`.

Follow the template to write the expert agent file. The template contains the full 9-section structure, frontmatter guidance, and the key principles for distilling knowledge into an opinionated persona.

#### 6.3: Write the Agent File

Write to `.claude/agents/{topic-slug}-expert.md` following the template.

#### 6.4: Present Result

> **Expert crystallized: {topic-slug}-expert**
>
> Saved to `.claude/agents/{topic-slug}-expert.md`
>
> This agent is now available in any session on this project. Invoke it by name or let Claude Code suggest it based on the trigger conditions in the description.

**Done.**

## Depth Flags Reference

| Flag | Behavior |
|------|----------|
| (none) | Interactive - full Phase 1, offer Phase 2 at the end |
| `--quick` | Phase 1 with lighter agent prompts (3-5 searches each instead of 5-10) |
| `--deep` | Phase 1 + auto-elaborate ALL branches without asking |
| `--exhaustive` | Deep + auto-run `/craft:research-verify` on all high-confidence findings |

## File Structure Reference

```
.craft/research/
  {topic-slug}/
    _plan.md                   # THE research doc - ranked index, TL;DR, convergence, conflicts, all sources
    _sources.md                # Citation index - trace any claim to its source URL, type, and branch
    01-{branch-slug}.md        # Branch 1 findings (written by researcher agent)
    02-{branch-slug}.md        # Branch 2 findings
    02-{branch-slug}--deep.md  # Phase 2 deeper findings on branch 2 (optional)
    02-{branch-slug}/          # Branch graduated to folder (went even deeper)
      README.md                # Sub-synthesis for this branch
      01-{sub-slug}.md         # Deeper sub-branch
      02-{sub-slug}.md
    03-{branch-slug}.md        # Branch 3 findings
    verification-{slug}.md     # Verification verdict (written by /craft:research-verify)
    ...
```

## Agent Configuration

All research agents use the **researcher** agent type (`craft:researcher`):
- **Model:** Sonnet (cost-efficient for retrieval + extraction)
- **Tools:** WebSearch, WebFetch, Read, Glob, Grep, Bash, Write
- **Writes directly to disk** - orchestrator context stays clean
- **Returns lightweight summary only** (~200 tokens) to orchestrator
