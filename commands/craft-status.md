## Status Indicators

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `○` | Ready/Pending |
| `◐` | In Progress |
| `✓` | Complete |
| `⚠` | Blocked |
| `✗` | Failed |

## Planning Section

If `.craft/planning/` exists, show a planning summary between the cycle dashboard and the backlog:

```
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Planning                          updated 2 days ago       │

├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
```

### Planning data gathering

Use **Glob** with pattern `$PROJECT/.craft/planning/active.md` to check if planning exists. If not found, skip the planning section silently.

If found:
1. Use **Read** to read `$PROJECT/.craft/planning/active.md`. Extract `last_updated` from frontmatter. Calculate days since last update. If >3 days, show "updated N days ago" in the header.
2. Use **Read** to read `$PROJECT/.craft/planning/README.md`. Extract the Roadmap table rows for initiative/concept names and statuses.
3. For each initiative folder (detected via Glob `$PROJECT/.craft/planning/*/README.md`), read the initiative README to get sub-concept count and statuses.
4. Scan for open questions: Use **Bash** to count `- [ ]` items across all planning `.md` files:
   ```bash
   grep -r "^- \[ \]" "${CRAFT_PROJECT_ROOT:-.}/.craft/planning/" --include="*.md" 2>/dev/null | wc -l
   ```
5. **Broken link check:** For each concept file with a `stories:` frontmatter field containing paths, use **Glob** to verify each story path exists. Flag any that don't resolve as `[broken]` in the output.

### Planning display rules

- Show initiatives as indented groups with their sub-concepts
- Show standalone concepts at root level
- Status indicators: `open`, `planned`, `complete`, `archived`
- Show open questions count if >0
- Show broken story links if any found
- If `last_updated` is missing from active.md frontmatter, show "updated: unknown"

## Data Sources

Read from:
- `.craft/.global-state` — active cycle, global config
- `.craft/cycles/*/cycle.yaml` — cycle details
- `.craft/cycles/*/.state` — cycle state
- `.craft/cycles/*/stories/*.md` — story details
- `.craft/backlog/*.md` — backlog stories
- `.craft/planning/active.md` — planning live state (if exists)
- `.craft/planning/README.md` — planning roadmap index (if exists)
- `.craft/planning/*/README.md` — initiative details (if exists)
- `.craft/map/capability.json` — Living Map capability verdict (if exists)
- `.craft/map/index.json` — Living Map index: areas + per-file anchor keys (if exists)

## Map status

The Living Map is an unrequested optimization, so its status is **pulled here, never pushed** - no toast or notice fires when a grammar degrades; the only place a user learns the map's state is by asking for it.

Render ONE line, only if `.craft/map/` exists (a project that has never needed the map shows nothing - that is the normal first-run state, not an error). Read `.craft/map/capability.json`:
- `mode: full` — `Map: active · N langs` (N = grammars that loaded true)
- `mode: partial` — `Map: active · N langs · M degraded` (M = grammars that loaded false; name them, e.g. "C# - why?", the "why?" pointing at `commands/references/map.md`)
- `mode: floor` — `Map: basic mode (full parsing unavailable - see references/map.md)`
- `mode: disabled` — `Map: off (map.enabled: false)`

This is render-only: read the cached verdict and print the line in the dashboard's existing style. Do NOT probe, build, or re-derive anything from the status command.

## Implementation

Set `PROJECT` to `${CRAFT_PROJECT_ROOT:-.}`.

Use **Read** to read `$PROJECT/.craft/.global-state`. Parse key=value pairs to extract `ACTIVE_CYCLE`, `CURRENT_STORY`, etc.

Use **Glob** with pattern `$PROJECT/.craft/cycles/*/cycle.yaml` to find all cycles.
For each cycle, use **Read** to read `cycle.yaml` for status and **Read** to read `.state` for progress.
Use **Glob** with pattern `$PROJECT/.craft/cycles/[cycle-name]/stories/*.md` to list stories per cycle.

Use **Glob** with pattern `$PROJECT/.craft/backlog/*.md` → count results → `backlog_count`.

## Options

- `/craft status` — Full dashboard (default)
- `/craft status --cycle` — Current cycle only
- `/craft status --backlog` — Backlog list only
- `/craft status --story` — Current story details

## Quick Aliases

For convenience, these shortcuts should also work:
- `/s` — Current story details
- `/c` — Current cycle overview
- `/b` — Backlog list

## Output

The dashboard IS the answer. Render it, then close with 2-3 SHORT next-move suggestions in plain prose - and stop. No question widget: nothing here blocks on a choice, and a dialog would cover the very table the user just asked to see.

Derive the suggestions from the state you just rendered - name the specific story or cycle and the command that advances it. Never offer canned moves the data contradicts (no "continue current story" when no story is active). Examples of the shape:

> Story 14 (agent-finding-handoff) is still unplanned - `/craft:plan-chunks` gets it ready.
> The active story is mid-chunk (3/5) - `/craft:story-continue` picks it back up.
> All stories in this cycle are complete - `/craft:cycle-complete` archives it.

Then end the turn. The user replies conversationally and normal routing takes it from there.
