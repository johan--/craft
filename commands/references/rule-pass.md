# Rule Pass

You are running a rule pass: mining accumulated fix records in `.craft/fixes/` for patterns worth graduating into `.claude/rules/`. This file is the single source of truth for the procedure - reflect points here; nothing inlines it.

**The design principle is THIN.** All judgment (pattern detection, one-off filtering, knowledge of the live `.claude/rules/` spec) lives inside the `claude-code-guide` agent. Your job is to invoke it, translate its proposals into plain English, take one organic approval reply, write what was approved, and advance the watermark. Do not add clustering, pre-filters, or per-proposal question chains.

## Constraint: Main Loop Only

**This procedure runs from the main conversation loop, never delegated to a Task subagent.** Subagents cannot spawn other subagents, so a delegated pass could not reach `claude-code-guide`. If you are reading this file as a subagent, stop and report back that the pass must run from the main loop.

## The Threshold and the Watermark

- **Threshold:** read `rule_pass_threshold` from `.craft/settings.yaml` via grep. If the file or key is absent, default to **10**. The file is allowed not to exist - never error on a missing settings.yaml.

  ```bash
  THRESHOLD=$(grep -m1 '^rule_pass_threshold:' "${CRAFT_PROJECT_ROOT:-.}/.craft/settings.yaml" 2>/dev/null | sed 's/^rule_pass_threshold:[[:space:]]*//')
  THRESHOLD=${THRESHOLD:-10}
  ```

- **Count:** `hooks/scripts/count-ungraduated-fixes.sh` outputs a bare integer - the number of fix records whose frontmatter `created:` is strictly after `last_pass_at` in `.craft/fixes/.rule-pass-state`. A missing state file means the corpus has never been mined: every record counts.

- **The watermark gates the OFFER, never the agent's input.** The agent always reads the FULL fix corpus. Old fixes are never used up - a one-off correctly rejected in one pass can combine with newer fixes into a pattern in a later pass, and updates to existing rules may cite evidence from any era.

## Step 1: Invoke the Agent

Invoke `claude-code-guide` (built into Claude Code) via the Agent tool with this prompt - it is the validated prompt from the proven run; adapt paths only:

> Read every `.craft/fixes/*.md` and every `.claude/rules/*.md` in this project. Verify the live `.claude/rules/` frontmatter and `paths:` spec against the official Claude Code docs before proposing any format. Find patterns where 2-3+ fixes point the same causal direction. Ruthlessly reject one-offs (a prior calibration run found ~41% of fix records rule-worthy and ~59% correctly rejected - expect to reject most). For each pattern, propose either UPDATE-existing (preferred - quote the loose part of the current rule and the tightened wording) or NEW (complete spec-correct file content, with `paths:` glob-scoping if the rule is file-type-specific). Cite the supporting fix names for every proposal. Output proposals only - write nothing.

While the agent runs, tell the user what is happening (it reads the whole corpus; expect a couple of minutes).

## Step 2: Present Proposals in Plain English

Translate the agent's proposals before presenting - the agent may be technical in its analysis; the user gets plain English. Number each proposal so the user can reply with numbers. Each proposal gets:

1. A number and a plain-English name, tagged **(update to existing rule)** or **(new rule)**
2. One to two sentences: what kept going wrong, and what the rule would prevent
3. The supporting fix names as evidence

Format:

```
**Rule pass complete. [N] proposals from [M] fixes:**

**1. [Plain-English name] (update to existing rule)**
[What went wrong across the cited fixes. What the tightened rule prevents.]
*Evidence: [fix-name], [fix-name], [fix-name]*

**2. [Plain-English name] (new rule)**
[What went wrong. What the rule prevents.]
*Evidence: [fix-name], [fix-name]*

...

Which should I write? (e.g. "1 and 3", "all", "none", or ask me about any of them)
```

If the agent rejected everything (zero proposals), say so plainly, note roughly how many records it reviewed, and skip to Step 5 - the pass still completes and the watermark still advances.

## Step 3: The Review Guardrail

**Only write rules the user explicitly named or clearly approved.** "1 and 3", "all", "the first two" are approvals. An ambiguous reply about a proposal ("hmm, the third one is interesting") is NOT approval - ask about that specific proposal instead of guessing. If the user asks to modify a proposal's wording, apply their modification and confirm it landed in the written rule.

This is one organic conversation reply - never a chain of per-proposal AskUserQuestion prompts.

## Step 4: Write Approved Rules

Write each approved rule to the current project's `.claude/rules/`. Updates edit the existing rule file; new rules create a new file with the agent's spec-verified content.

That is the entire write surface. No commit, no gitignore check, no tracking caveat - committing is the user's normal git life.

## Step 5: Receipt, Then Watermark

Print one unambiguous closing statement:

```
Rule pass receipt: wrote [N] rules ([filenames]), skipped [M], modified [K] per your notes. Watermark advanced.
```

Then - and only then - advance the watermark by writing today's date:

```bash
printf 'last_pass_at: %s\n' "$(date +%Y-%m-%d)" > "${CRAFT_PROJECT_ROOT:-.}/.craft/fixes/.rule-pass-state"
```

**Advance rules:**
- Pass completed, some or all proposals approved -> advance.
- Pass completed, every proposal rejected (or zero proposals) -> still advance. The corpus was reviewed; re-offering the same evidence next time is the nag this design avoids.
- The user declined the OFFER (the pass never ran) -> do NOT advance. The caller handles this case; if you are reading this file, the offer was accepted.

The state file is durable - it survives sessions and is only ever written by this step.
