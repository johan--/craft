# Agent Catalog

> Reference for all 24 agents in the Craft plugin. Agents run in isolated context - they receive only what you pass in their prompt.

Craft agents fall into four categories based on when you encounter them and what invokes them. The first question to ask is always: does this need to be an agent at all, or can a skill or hook do the job deterministically?

---

## Core Workflow Agents

These agents run inside the implementation pipeline. The orchestrator invokes them via the Task tool. You rarely interact with them directly - they're invoked by skills like `plan-chunks` and `validate-chunk`.

| Agent | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `implementer` | sonnet | Owns the implement-validate-refine loop per chunk. Full write access within the active story scope. The workhorse of the pipeline. |
| `tester` | sonnet | Integration tests and E2E after all chunks complete. Runs the full test suite, fixes failures. |
| `chunk-validator` | haiku | Runs quality checks (typecheck, lint, no-any, build, tests, design tokens) and returns a structured validation report. Reports only - never fixes. Haiku keeps this fast and cheap. |
| `plan-chunks-agent` | sonnet | Autonomous chunk planning for a single story. Used by `plan-chunks` skill in batch mode - one agent per story, runs in parallel. |
| `project-scanner` | sonnet | Full project analysis for documentation updates. Invoked by `/craft:update-docs`. |

**Key constraint:** `implementer` and `tester` receive full write access. `chunk-validator` and `plan-chunks-agent` are read-only. `project-scanner` writes only to `.craft/`.

---

## Analysis Agents

Post-cycle agents that inspect the live app. Invoked by `/craft:analyze` and automatically at cycle completion for UI cycles. All analysis agents use `chrome-devtools` MCP except `playwright-browser`, which uses `playwright-cli`.

| Agent | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `qa-analyzer` | sonnet | Bug hunting via browser inspection. Finds functional errors, broken states, console errors. |
| `ux-analyzer` | sonnet | Nielsen heuristics, accessibility, mental models. Evaluates the user experience against usability principles. |
| `creative-analyzer` | sonnet | Delight moments, viral potential, "beautiful wrong" patterns. Evaluates emotional resonance. |
| `style-analyzer` | sonnet | Design token compliance, pattern consistency, visual system integrity. |
| `walkthrough-analyzer` | sonnet | Interactive first-time user simulation. Clicks everything, tests every state transition. Chrome DevTools MCP only - never reads source code. 45 tool-call budget with structured preflight checklist. Auto-triggers at cycle completion for UI cycles. |

**Walkthrough vs QA analyzer distinction:** `walkthrough-analyzer` acts as a naive user and never reads source code. `qa-analyzer` uses browser inspection but can correlate findings with code patterns. Use walkthrough for user-experience issues; use QA for functional correctness.

**Quick-fix exception:** Walkthrough findings with `complexity: quick-fix` and a `fix_hint` may be applied directly by the orchestrator without spawning an implementer agent. This is the only exception to the "always use implementer" rule.

## Review and Research Agents

Agents that support code review, research, and verification workflows. Invoked by `/craft:review`, `/craft:research`, and `/craft:research-verify`.

| Agent | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `pr-reviewer-expert` | sonnet | PR review crystallized from CodeRabbit's architecture. Reads `locked.md` and `project.md` before forming any opinion. Two severity levels: issue (must fix) and suggestion (consider). Never comments on style if a linter exists. |
| `maze-architect` | haiku | Generates 2-4 review questions from a raw diff with zero intent context. Never sees commit messages. Used by `/craft:review --maze` to create perpendicular review routes. Haiku model because the task is pattern recognition, not judgment. |
| `researcher` | haiku | Constrained extraction for one research sub-question - verbatim quotes, source-backed findings, no synthesis. Writes a branch file, returns a lightweight summary. Used by `/craft:research`. |
| `research-synthesizer` | sonnet | Reads all branch files in a research topic and writes `_plan.md` + `_sources.md`. Preserves conflicts verbatim, re-enforces the evidence gate, runs quote-claim alignment. Replaces the orchestrator-side synthesis that used to run in the main loop. Model locked - see its rationale block. |
| `verifier` | haiku | Adversarial claim checker for `/craft:research-verify`. Takes one finding and tries to disprove it using independent primary sources. Local evidence before web search; guarded against premature UNVERIFIABLE. |
| `practitioner-reviewer` | sonnet | Challenges verified claims from practical experience. Catches "true in docs, wrong in practice." No web search - relies on practitioner knowledge. Used by `/craft:research-verify` practitioner mode. |

**Maze review flow:** `maze-architect` (haiku, no intent) generates questions → `pr-reviewer-expert` (sonnet, full context) answers them. The architect's naivety is the feature, not a limitation.

## Browser Automation Agent

| Agent | Model | Purpose |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `playwright-browser` | sonnet | Owns a live browser session via `playwright-cli`. Navigates, clicks, fills forms, reads accessibility snapshots. Invoked by the `browser` skill (`/craft:browser`). ~4x cheaper than Chrome DevTools MCP in token cost (snapshots saved to disk as YAML, not streamed into context). 60 tool-call budget. |

**Session name rule:** Names must be 12 characters or fewer, lowercase alphanumeric only. macOS has a 104-char Unix socket path limit. Long names silently overflow and spawn duplicate browsers instead of erroring.

**playwright-browser vs walkthrough-analyzer:** `playwright-browser` is interactive - you steer it via SendMessage across turns. `walkthrough-analyzer` runs autonomously with a structured test plan. Use `playwright-browser` for exploration and targeted testing; use `walkthrough-analyzer` for systematic post-cycle review.

## Crystallized Expert Agents

These agents were built using `/craft:become` - a psychological research process that reconstructs how a domain expert thinks, not just what they know. Each carries beliefs, scar tissue, and instincts from their source research. They're designed for consultation, not pipeline execution.

Invoke via `/craft:ask` for intelligent routing, or directly via the Agent tool in skills and commands.

```mermaid

    Q[Your question] --> A[/craft:ask]
    A --> M[muse\nemotional job]

    A --> PR[pr-reviewer-expert\ncode review]

    A --> PA[product-anthropologist\nuser truth]
```

| Agent | Model | Crystallized From | Consult When |
|-------|-------|-------------------|--------------|
| `muse` | sonnet | `.craft/research/product-intuition-become/` | Evaluating whether a feature will generate word-of-mouth, translating user requests into emotional jobs, "nobody will tell their friend about this" gut checks |
| `alchemist` | sonnet | `.craft/research/css-interaction-alchemist-become/` | Building UI that needs to feel alive - scroll-driven reveals, morphing transitions, spatial animation. Sees CSS as a physics engine, not a styling language. |
| `conductor` | sonnet | `.craft/research/conductor-become/` | Designing agent workflows, choosing between skill/hook/agent/rule, diagnosing why an agentic system is failing silently |
| `doc-writer` | sonnet | `.craft/research/technical-documentation-writer-become/` | Writing or reviewing any documentation - README files, architecture docs, API references, tutorials, decision records |
| `product-anthropologist` | sonnet | (role-based crystallization) | Diagnosing why users aren't adopting, interpreting user feedback, evaluating whether a product solves a real problem |
| `crystallizer` | opus | `.craft/research/expert-cognition-transfer/` | Synthesizing research branch files into a 9-section agent persona. Invoked by `/craft:become` Phase 3. Opus because this is the highest-judgment task in the system. |
| `become-researcher` | sonnet | (role-based crystallization) | Collecting psychological material for `/craft:become`. Gathers beliefs, scar tissue, axioms - NOT facts. One per sub-question, runs in parallel. |

**Stale signals:** Each crystallized agent's frontmatter includes `stale_signals` - specific conditions that would make the agent's beliefs outdated. Check these before trusting the agent in changed environments.

**Handbook references:** Some agents reference their research folder via `research_handbook:` in frontmatter. When you need citations or deeper context, the handbook points you to the raw branch files.

## How to Choose

```
Need to do implementation work?  → skill + pipeline agents (implementer, tester, etc.)
Need to inspect a live app?      → analysis agents (walkthrough, QA, UX, style, creative)
Need to review code?             → /craft:review (standard) or /craft:review --maze (perpendicular)
Need to research a topic?        → /craft:research (researcher + verifier + practitioner-reviewer)
Need expert judgment?            → /craft:ask (routes to crystallized experts)
Need to build a new expert?      → /craft:become (become-researcher + crystallizer)
```

`/craft:ask` scans agent descriptions and recommends the best match. It skips operational agents (implementer, tester, chunk-validator, etc.) and routes to consultable agents only.
