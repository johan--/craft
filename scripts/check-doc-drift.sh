# check-doc-drift.sh - deterministic structural doc-drift check for the craft plugin.
#
# CONTRIBUTOR TOOLING - for developing craft ITSELF. It checks craft's own docs
# (agent-catalog, decision-tree, README, DESIGN) against craft's own source files.
# It is NOT a feature for projects built with craft - it is inert in any other repo.
#
# Caller-agnostic: reads no stdin, emits no JSON. exit 0 = clean, exit 1 = drift.
# Prints specific, actionable findings to stderr. Reusable by the push-gate
# wrapper, manual runs, a future CI job, and the guide agent's read-only query.
#
# Iron rule: every expected value is DERIVED FROM SOURCE (ls/grep over the live
# tree). Nothing about the inventory is hardcoded - a hardcoded number would
# itself drift, which is the exact bug this guards against.
#
# Guards STRUCTURAL truth only (counts, missing/renamed entries, orphans, a
# known retired string). Semantic truth (does a described flow match behavior?)
# is out of scope and handled elsewhere on demand.
