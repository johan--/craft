# Adhoc Tweak Flow (reference - read inline by the craft:adhoc shell)

<!-- DO NOT SIMPLIFY THIS SCHEMA. Tweak records are mined by a future graduation
     pass that clusters them (by kind, surface, attempts, verbatim reactions) into
     project-level skills - the way fix records graduate into rules, tweak records
     graduate into taste. Every field below exists to serve that pass. Dropping a
     field or paraphrasing user reactions destroys the signal. -->

This is the TWEAK flavor: nothing is broken - something works as built, and the user wants it different. A different icon, tighter spacing, calmer wording. The gate here is not root-cause confidence ("will it work") but **fit** ("will it fit"). The shell has already classified the request, opened the write gate, and created the close-obligation tasks - this file owns the tweak record, the Fit Check, the attempt loop, and the close-out. Hand back to the shell for each commit and the final gate close.

The word "enhancement" never appears in tweak filenames or frontmatter values - "tweak" is the term, everywhere. This keeps the corpus fully separate from craft:analyze's `enhance-*` proposal records: those are agent-generated ideas; these are user-driven changes with real reactions attached.

## Step 1: Create the Tweak Record

**Check for a matching move first:** before treating the request as novel, glance at recent records - `grep -l "kind: [matching-kind]" .craft/tweaks/*.md` and skim by `created:` date. If an accepted tweak already made this same move on another surface, this is a REAPPLICATION: set `reapplies:` to that record's name (see below). Reapplied moves inherit a proven direction, and the backlink count is the graduation signal.

Create `.craft/tweaks/` if it doesn't exist, then write the record:

```bash
mkdir -p "${CRAFT_PROJECT_ROOT:-.}/.craft/tweaks"
```

Write to `.craft/tweaks/tweak-[descriptive-slug].md`:

```markdown
---
name: tweak-[descriptive-slug]
status: open
created: [YYYY-MM-DD]
project: [project name]
surface: [free-text kebab slug for WHERE in the product, e.g. settings-toolbar]
kind: [icon | copy | spacing | color | motion | content]
source_story: [story that built the element, if known]
reapplies: [name of the original tweak this reapplies, e.g. tweak-toolbar-stroke-weight - empty for a novel tweak]
attempts: 0
outcome_note:
files_changed: 0
lines_changed: 0
---

## Request
[The user's ask, close to verbatim. "Different icon than what we added - something more like a hammer"]

## Fit Check
[Filled in Step 2]
```

**`surface`:** before minting a new slug, check the existing records - `grep -h "^surface:" .craft/tweaks/*.md | sort -u` - and reuse a matching slug. Consistent surfaces are what let the future mining pass cluster ("five tweaks on settings-toolbar").

**`kind`:** exactly one of `icon | copy | spacing | color | motion | content`.

**`reapplies`:** backlink to the original tweak when this record applies an already-accepted move to a new surface. Every reapplication gets its OWN record (one file per surface - records never bloat with multi-surface history); the shared `reapplies:` value is what ties the family together. The count of records naming the same original is the graduation vote: a move applied in several places is a standard waiting to be written down (tokens.yaml for value kinds like spacing/color, locked.md via lock-decision for patterns - the graduation pass consumes this).

**`status` lifecycle:** born `open`, stays `open` until the user explicitly closes it - `accepted` (first attempt landed), `revised-then-accepted` (took 2+ attempts), `abandoned` (user dropped it), or `escalated` (became a story/design question). **Validation passing never closes a tweak. Only the user's reaction does.** A later conversational decline also abandons an open record - name it explicitly before writing ("Closing `tweak-settings-icon` as abandoned"), never guess which record the user means when more than one is open.

## Step 2: Fit Check

Before editing anything, answer "will it fit?" - the tweak equivalent of the fix flow's confidence check:

1. **Survey the neighborhood.** What sits next to this element - same row, same toolbar, same card? Read the surrounding component code; for UI, screenshot the surface as it is now (this is also your before-shot - if the shell already took a classification screenshot, reuse it, don't re-take).
2. **Match the visual family.** An icon next to existing icons should mirror their language: stroke vs filled, weight, corner radius, metaphor register. Copy should match the surrounding voice; spacing should follow the established rhythm.
3. **Check the design contracts.** Read `.craft/design/tokens.yaml` and `.craft/design/locked.md` - does the change use existing tokens and respect locked decisions? Also glance at `.craft/quality.yaml`'s standards (touch targets, contrast). A conflict with tokens.yaml or quality.yaml is noted SILENTLY in the Fit Check section as a pending reconcile payload - never interrupt the user mid-tweak over it; it gets its one question at acceptance (see Acceptance reconcile, Step 3). A conflict with a locked decision routes through the pre-edit branch below, before anything is edited. This Fit-Check note only PRE-SEEDS the token reconcile - it is not the sole detection point: tokens are re-derived from the FINAL accepted values at acceptance regardless (Step 3), so a token drift that was absent or matching here and only emerged as attempts progressed is still caught.

Write the findings into the `## Fit Check` section: where the element lives, what its siblings look like, which conventions apply, and how the requested change fits them.

**Lock conflict (pre-edit):** if the requested change would break a locked decision, do NOT edit yet. The tweak is the user's taste showing up live - the lock may be what's stale. Present a recommendation: alter the lock, remove it, or reshape the tweak to fit it - whichever the neighborhood evidence supports. On the user's explicit yes, update locked.md FIRST via the inline lock-edit path below, then proceed with the tweak - the edit never exists in a lock-breaking state. On decline, fall back to escalation: update `status: escalated`, tell the user why, and suggest design-vibe or a story. Hand back to the shell to close the gate. (Mention the option; do not invoke another skill from inside this flow.)

**Escalation (design question):** if the fit check surfaces a genuine design question (multiple plausible directions and no clear fit) - do NOT edit. Same mechanics as the decline path above: update `status: escalated`, say why, suggest design-vibe or a story, hand back to the shell.

### The inline lock-edit path

Two reconcile moments may alter or remove a locked.md entry: the pre-edit branch above, and the Acceptance reconcile in Step 3. The rules, defined once:

- **Explicit yes only.** "yes", "lock it", "go with that" - an explicit yes. Hedged agreement ("that could work"), agreement carrying an open question, or thinking out loud NEVER updates locked.md.
- **Edit locked.md directly, in its existing format** - alter the entry or remove it. Same discipline as the lock-decision skill, none of the ceremony: never run lock-decision's unlock-ceremony AUQ from inside a tweak thread. One clean yes, zero extra questions.
- **A lock gets at most ONE write moment per tweak thread** - at the pre-edit branch (conflict known at the brief) or at the Acceptance reconcile (conflict emerged mid-pass). Never per attempt: attempt-level agreement is exploration, not settled taste, and locked.md never records mid-pass wobble.

## Step 3: The Attempt Loop

Each attempt appends a block to the record:

```markdown
## Attempt [N]
### Change
[What was edited, which files, and how the fit check shaped the choice]
### Validation
[Tests/build result; for visual tweaks, before/after screenshots - the after-shot doubles as the fit-check receipt]
### Reaction
[The user's response, VERBATIM]
```

Per attempt:

1. **Mid-pass lock pivot check.** When the user's reaction changes the brief's direction ("actually, make it sharper"), re-screen the NEW direction against locked.md (already in context from the Fit Check) before editing. If it crosses a lock the brief didn't: say ONE ignorable line - "that crosses the [X] lock; trying it anyway - we'll settle the lock if this is what you accept" - and proceed. No question, no AUQ, and NO locked.md write mid-pass; the lock settles once, at the Acceptance reconcile. Direction unchanged, or no lock crossed → silence.
2. **Change.** Make the edits with Edit/Write. Increment `attempts`, update `files_changed` / `lines_changed`.
3. **Validate.** Run the project's tests/build. For anything visual, use the browser: navigate to the surface, take the after screenshot, and confirm the change landed as the fit check intended. Record it in the attempt's Validation.
4. **Commit.** Hand back to the shell's commit step (manifest staging, `tweak:` prefix). Every validated attempt commits - the custody chain holds even if the record stays open.
5. **Close-out ask.** Use **AskUserQuestion**:

```
question: "How does it look?"
header: "Tweak"
options:
  - label: "Looks good"
    description: "Close this tweak as accepted"
  - label: "Looks good - apply elsewhere"
    description: "Accept it, then reapply the same move to other surfaces"
  - label: "Not quite"
    description: "Tell me what's off - I'll take another pass"
```

6. **Route the reaction - capture it VERBATIM:**
   - **"Looks good"** (or equivalent typed approval): write it to the attempt's Reaction and to `outcome_note`. Set `status: accepted` (attempt 1) or `revised-then-accepted` (2+). Run the Acceptance reconcile below (skipped when no payload is pending), then continue to Step 4.
   - **"Looks good - apply elsewhere":** close THIS record exactly as "Looks good" above (the move proved out - propagation never reopens it). Run the Acceptance reconcile below at THIS moment - BEFORE the reapply batch, so propagation only ever copies a fully-legal move - then run Reapplying Elsewhere (Step 3b) inside the same work thread before Step 4.
   - **Typed criticism** ("the alignment is still off"): write the exact words to the attempt's Reaction. Leave `status: open`. Loop to the next attempt - the reaction is the new brief.
   - **Explicit decline** ("never mind", "drop it", "not worth another pass"): write the exact words to the attempt's Reaction and to `outcome_note`. Set `status: abandoned`. If a mid-pass lock pivot was announced this thread, revert those attempts' edits (the shell's per-attempt commits make this surgical) - an abandoned tweak leaves locked.md untouched and the working tree conforming. Hand back to the shell to close the gate.
   - **No reaction / user changes topic:** leave `status: open` and the record as-is. Do not nag, do not mark accepted. Hand back to the shell to close the gate (the gate closes with the thread; the record's openness is independent bookkeeping). If the user raises it again - this session or any later one - reopen the loop from the recorded reactions.

### Acceptance reconcile (one beat)

**First, re-derive the token payload from the FINAL accepted values - never trust the Fit Check's pre-edit note alone.** Token drift is a final-state property: a tweak that iterates ("warmer", "tighter", "sharper") or grows in scope mid-loop can land on color, spacing, timing, or radius values that were absent or matching at the Fit Check and only drifted as attempts progressed - and the Fit Check, running before any edit, cannot see them. So at EVERY acceptance, scan the values the accepted attempt actually shipped (the files in `files_changed`) against `.craft/design/tokens.yaml`: any shipped design value that maps to no existing token, or overrides one, is a pending token payload - whether or not the Fit Check flagged it. This scan runs unconditionally; the Fit-Check note only pre-seeds it.

The beat is then entered when ANY payload is pending: the token payload just derived, a quality-floor miss noted at the Fit Check, an emergent lock conflict announced at a mid-pass pivot, or a lock the accepted work OUTGREW without contradicting (the lock says round buttons; the accepted pass rounded the cards too). No payload of any kind → skip this entirely - the close-out is exactly the routing above, unchanged, and nothing new is asked or written.

Tokens and quality are NOT the same kind of contract. tokens.yaml is descriptive - it records the values in use, so a drift reconciles by updating the doc to the accepted value. quality.yaml is prescriptive - its numbers (touch target, contrast) are FLOORS, so a miss is fixed in the work or tolerated as a noted exception; the floor is never lowered to match a violation. The two questions below reflect that asymmetry.

It fires immediately after either "Looks good" variant closes the record - at the ORIGINAL's acceptance, always BEFORE any Step 3b reapplication. Multi-attempt tweaks reconcile once, here, against the FINAL accepted values.

One beat means ONE AskUserQuestion call - include only the questions whose payload is pending (any subset of the four below), never ask them serially:

```
question (only if an emergent lock conflict is unsettled): "The accepted tweak crosses the [X] lock - settle it?"
header: "Lock"
options:
  - label: "Update the lock"
    description: "Alter/remove [X] in locked.md to match the accepted values - explicit yes, via the inline lock-edit path (Step 2)"
  - label: "Conform the work"
    description: "Revert or reshape the offending part to respect the lock as written"

question (only if a token drift was detected - at the Fit Check or the acceptance re-scan): "[value] ended at [accepted] but tokens.yaml says [documented] - solidify?"
header: "Solidify"
options:
  - label: "Update the doc"
    description: "The accepted value becomes the documented token"
  - label: "Leave as drift"
    description: "Keep tokens.yaml as-is; this surface is a tolerated exception"

question (only if a quality-floor miss was detected): "The accepted [value] misses the [X] standard (quality.yaml floor: [floor]) - conform it?"
header: "Conform"
options:
  - label: "Fix the work"
    description: "Revert or reshape the accepted change to meet the [X] floor - quality.yaml is a minimum, not a value to relax"
  - label: "Leave as a known exception"
    description: "Ship below the floor as a deliberate, noted exception; quality.yaml is untouched"

question (only if the work outgrew a lock): "This pass applied [X]'s move beyond its scope ([new surfaces]) - widen the lock to match?"
header: "Widen"
options:
  - label: "Widen the lock"
    description: "Update [X] to the proven scope - explicit yes, via the inline lock-edit path"
  - label: "Leave it"
    description: "The lock stays narrow; the extra surfaces stay unclaimed"
```

There is no third door on the lock question: a tweak never CLOSES in a lock-breaking state. "Update the lock" requires the explicit yes the inline lock-edit path demands; anything less conforms the work. The quality question likewise has no "lower the floor" door - quality.yaml is a minimum, so a miss is fixed or tolerated as a noted exception, never solidified downward.

### Snowball offer

After the reconcile beat settles (or, for a reapplication family, after the batched close-out settles) - and ONLY if a rule changed in this thread (a lock altered/removed, or tokens.yaml updated) - offer the sweep as one ignorable closing line, per notebook conventions, never an AskUserQuestion:

> "That changed [rule] - worth a sweep TODO in /craft:notebook to find other surfaces that could inherit it? Otherwise moving on."

On accept, capture the notebook todo silently with session context: the rule that changed, the surfaces already touched - the offer may name the whole family. Silence or decline → nothing. No rule change → no offer. New rules are BORN at the sweep, not here: alter/remove happens at the conflict moment; ADD ("buttons are round now") waits until the sweep proves scope.

There is NO lesson-capture step on the tweak path - that belongs to fixes. The record's verbatim reactions ARE the learning payload here.

## Step 3b: Reapplying Elsewhere

The user chose to propagate an accepted move. The original record is already closed; the work thread (gate, task pair) stays open.

1. **Ask where - never scan by default.** "Where else should this land?" The user usually knows ("also the profile cards"). Offer the scan as a visibly priced opt-in in the same breath: "Or I can look for candidates - that means scanning [named scope, e.g. the components directory] for similar [kind] patterns." Run a scan ONLY on explicit acceptance, and scope it by the tweak's kind and surface - grep for the matching pattern, never a whole-project read. An unrequested full-project scan is the failure mode this step exists to prevent.
2. **One record per target.** Each target surface gets its own `tweak-[slug].md` with `reapplies:` set to the original's name. One file per surface - the family tree lives in the backlinks, never in one bloated record.
3. **Abbreviated loop per target:** Fit Check the NEW neighborhood (siblings differ - the move may need local adaptation, and a target where it genuinely doesn't fit gets said out loud, not forced), then run the same per-attempt mechanics as Step 3 on the target's own record: write its `## Attempt 1` block (Change/Validation), increment its `attempts`, update its `files_changed` / `lines_changed`, edit, validate, commit (shell's commit step).
4. **Batched close-out.** ONE "How do they look?" ask for the whole batch, targets named - not one ask per target. The user's reply closes all records it approves (same verbatim reaction in each); a called-out target ("checkout's still off") loops just that record's attempt cycle. The family close-out fires NO second reconcile beat - the rules were settled at the original's acceptance, and each reapplied target conformed to the now-current rules at its own Fit Check.
5. When the batch settles, run the Snowball offer (Step 3) if a rule changed this thread - it may name the whole family - then continue to Step 4. The summary covers the family: original + N reapplications.

## Step 4: Close

Output a summary. For a single tweak:

```
## Adhoc Tweak: [name]
Surface: [surface] | Kind: [kind]
Attempts: [N]
Outcome: [status] - "[outcome_note]"
Files: [N] changed, [N] lines
```

For a reapplication batch, one line per record in the family:

```
## Adhoc Tweak: [original name] + [N] reapplications
- [surface] ([kind]): [status] - "[outcome_note]", [N] files/[N] lines
- [surface] ([kind]): [status] - "[outcome_note]", [N] files/[N] lines
```

Then hand back to the shell to close the gate (Step 6 there).
