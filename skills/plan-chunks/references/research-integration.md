# Research Integration

How to gather context before planning begins. This covers sibling story analysis and the plan-chunks-agent launch.

## Sibling Context Gathering (Phase 0.1b)

**Skip if:** Story is in backlog (no cycle context).

**If story is in a cycle:**

1. **Scan sibling stories:**
   Use **Glob** `"[cycle_directory]/stories/*.md"` → list of story files.
   Exclude the current story from the list.

2. **Quick relevance check** for each sibling:
   - Read sibling's frontmatter + first 50 lines (spark, scope)
   - Check for keyword overlap with current story (e.g., both mention "auth", "user", "form")
   - Check for file path overlap in scope sections
   - Check if sibling has `status: ready` or `complete` (planned work)

3. **Relevance heuristics:**
   | Signal | Weight |
   |--------|--------|
   | Same file paths in scope | High — definitely related |
   | Same domain keywords (auth, api, dashboard) | Medium — likely related |
   | Same component types (form, modal, table) | Medium — may share patterns |
   | Different domains entirely | Low — probably unrelated |
   | Sibling is `planning` with no chunks | Medium — read spark, check for keyword/file overlap. Planning siblings are the MOST important to check because they're about to plan against the same codebase. Do NOT skip them. |

4. **If related siblings found**, extract from each:
   - Story name and status
   - Files mentioned in scope (included section)
   - Files in chunks (if chunks exist)
   - Key decisions locked

5. **Build sibling context block:**
   ```markdown
   **Sibling story context:**

   ### [Sibling Name] (status: ready)
   - **Files:** src/components/Auth/, src/hooks/useAuth.ts
   - **Decisions:** React Hook Form for forms, JWT in cookies
   - **Overlap:** Both touch src/components/Auth/

   ### [Another Sibling] (status: complete)
   - **Files:** src/lib/api.ts, src/types/user.ts
   - **Decisions:** Zod for validation
   - **Overlap:** Both modify src/lib/api.ts
   ```

6. **If no relevant siblings:** Set context to `"No relevant siblings — stories appear unrelated."`

**Efficiency note:** This is a quick scan, not deep extraction. Read only what's needed to determine relevance. If a sibling is clearly unrelated (different domain, no file overlap), skip detailed extraction.

## Agent Launch Prompt — Single Story (Phase S-1)

**INVOKE the plan-chunks-agent using the Task tool:**

```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "craft:plan-chunks-agent"
  description: "Plan [story title]"
  prompt: "Research and plan this story.

  **Story file:** [full path to story .md file]
  **Cycle directory:** [path to cycle dir, or 'backlog' if not in cycle]
  **Project root:** [derived from story path — parent directory of .craft/]

  CRITICAL: SCOPE ALL SEARCHES to the project root above.
  Do NOT search the monorepo root or parent directories.
  Use the project root as the `path` parameter for ALL Glob and Grep calls.

  **Cycle goal:** [goal from cycle.yaml, or 'N/A' if backlog]

  [SIBLING CONTEXT FROM PHASE 0.1b]

  [OPTIONAL: Starting context from orchestrator — validate and deepen, don't rediscover from scratch:
    APPROACH: [value]
    DECISIONS: [value]
    KEY_FILES: [value]]

  Read the story, understand what it needs, then research the codebase and plan chunks.
  If the story's `## Visual Direction` has an Element Binding Table, verify each row's token against tokens.yaml and bind every row a chunk builds as a `[visual-source:]` Contract; route TBD rows to the Pitch conditions table.
  Return findings in your structured output format."
```

**Include sibling context:** Paste the sibling context block from Phase 0.1b directly into the prompt. If no relevant siblings, include: `"**Sibling context:** No relevant siblings — stories appear unrelated."`

**Include orchestrator context:** If args include `APPROACH:`, `DECISIONS:`, or `KEY_FILES:`, add the optional starting context block.

## Agent Launch Prompt - Multi-Story Batch (Phase M-2)

For batch planning, each agent receives all sibling names/sparks plus predecessor context for dependent stories:

```
Task tool:
  subagent_type: "craft:plan-chunks-agent"
  description: "Plan [story-name]"
  prompt: "Research and plan this story.

  **Story file:** [full path]
  **Cycle directory:** [path]
  **Project root:** [derived path]

  CRITICAL: SCOPE ALL SEARCHES to the project root above.
  Do NOT search the monorepo root or parent directories.
  Use the project root as the `path` parameter for ALL Glob and Grep calls.

  **Cycle goal:** [goal from cycle.yaml]

  **All stories in cycle (for sibling awareness):**
  [story-name-1]: [spark first sentence]
  [story-name-2]: [spark first sentence]
  ...

  [PREDECESSOR CONTEXT - if this story has in-set dependencies, include here.
  See SKILL.md M-2 'Predecessor Context Handoff' for the exact format:
  Goal + Files + Contracts from each predecessor chunk,
  with CRITICAL alignment instructions.]

  Read the story, understand what it needs, then research the codebase and plan chunks.
  If the story's `## Visual Direction` has an Element Binding Table, verify each row's token against tokens.yaml and bind every row a chunk builds as a `[visual-source:]` Contract; route TBD rows to the Pitch conditions table.
  Return findings in your structured output format."
```

**Key differences from single-story:**
- Batch mode provides ALL story names/sparks (not filtered by relevance) so the agent can detect file overlap and coordination needs with any sibling
- **Dependent stories include predecessor context** - the Goal, Files, and Contracts from each chunk of the story they depend on, with explicit instructions to align contracts (IDs, file paths, exports, naming conventions). See SKILL.md M-2 Predecessor Context Handoff for the full format.
