# test-gate-signals.sh - fixture-driven coverage for the stack-signal probe.
#
# The scan contract (present-manifests-only, prune list, depth cap, counts not
# paths) and the reconcile-state contract (lookup/record roundtrip, one line
# per signal) are load-bearing for gate coverage reporting, so they are unit
# tested here rather than trusted.
