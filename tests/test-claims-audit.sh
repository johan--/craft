# test-claims-audit.sh - Verify the claims-audit contract catches a planted false claim

# The claims-auditor agent verifies completion claims against on-disk artifacts
# (validation receipt, git diff, story file) before a story completes. A bash
# test cannot invoke the haiku agent, so these tests plant a false claim against
# a fixture receipt showing a FAILED test and assert the agent's CONTRACT
# resolves it unsupported, plus assert the anti-contamination, anti-transcript,
# and ordering wiring is present in the plugin files.
