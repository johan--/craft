# test-muse-gets-seen.sh - Guard Story 6's and Story 20's locked strings across the spec files.
# Doc-level assertions that the muse-visibility edits are specced as locked: the
# prose-then-widget turn presentation rule, the horizon line, the hard-rule annotations,
# the briefing surfacing beats ("Muse's take:" / "Alchemist's take:"), the mockup
# muse path (Story 20: one path, two doors - the reference file, the renamed warm
# option, the design-empty automatic fork, muse_session semantics), and the Phase 0.5
# Emotional Core sell. Adjacent stories edit these same shared files; a paraphrased
# rule, a resurrected silent-fold, or a resurrected (Recommended) marker should fail
# the suite, not slip through review.
