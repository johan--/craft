# test-mockup-tool-requests.sh - Guard Story 16's locked strings across the spec files.
# Doc-level assertions that the mockup material feature is specced as locked: the
# pinned `Tool request:` marker in BOTH producer (alchemist.md) and consumer
# (mockup-inline.md) - two different authors write the two halves, and a marker
# mismatch would silently no-op the whole feature - plus the distortion principle
# (no allowlist), the pinned fetch sources, orchestrator-owned fetching into the
# mockup's assets/ folder, silent-fetch disclosure, the degrade path, the record's
# `## Materials` schema, and both graduation ramps forwarding the material spec
# (identity, never the inlined bytes). Adjacent stories edit these same shared
# files; a paraphrased rule or a dropped marker should fail the suite, not slip
# through review.
