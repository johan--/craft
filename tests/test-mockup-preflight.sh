# test-mockup-preflight.sh - Guard Story 18's locked strings in the mockup funnel spec.
# Doc-level assertions that the first-run pre-flight beat is specced as locked: the
# Setup AUQ copy verbatim, the beat's position (after the cold-start determination,
# before the mkdir anchor), the amended taste-AUQ invariant, the never-escalate and
# scoped no-guess rules, the self-elimination property with its one deliberate
# exception (Init-first exits before the record), and the survival of the
# load-bearing guards (no-default-palette, substeps-never-tasks; the muse
# (Recommended) marker was removed by Story 20 - the muse path replaced it).
# The Scope AUQ was REMOVED at owner review 2026-07-17 (it minimalized the
# first-run wow) - a negative below guards against its return. Adjacent stories edit
# this same shared file; a paraphrased rule or re-voiced copy should fail the suite.
