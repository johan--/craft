# The plan-chunks structural check (row #8) scans a story's `## Risk Tags`
# section: for each `- tag-name    # comment` line in the risk_tags YAML block,
# ONLY the text after the first `#` is scanned. A comment carrying a numeric
# threshold with no mechanism/verification connective is flagged; a comment
# with no threshold always passes; tag names and YAML structure are never
# scanned. These tests run that exact logic against static fixtures and verify
# the authoring/consumption surfaces carry the rule.
