# test-alignment-gate-gets-seen.sh - Guard story 16's alignment-gate contract.
# The gate's five fixes live as exact strings: the Explore prompt's plain-language
# instruction (Step 1), the objective ask-vs-act filter (Step 2), the gate-time Read
# of the worked exemplar in place of the deleted batching mandate (Step 3), and the
# exemplar file itself modeling the full gate (lean + (Recommended)-first widget +
# 3-option shape). A paraphrase or a resurrected "group related findings" mandate
# should fail the suite, not slip through review.
