# test-plan-chunks-triage-grammar.sh - Guard story 17's plan-chunks gate-grammar contract.
# Plan-chunks' insight-bearing questions (the S-2 PLAN FORK, all five S-3 triage
# questions, batch BT-2/BT-3/BT-4) read the worked exemplar (auq-grammar.md) at
# question time; answers land in the story file at answer time with a truthful
# receipt line; BT-6 demotes to reconciliation; BT-5 "Adjust" re-planning binds
# already-landed decisions. The distinct closers survive, and NO non-insight AUQ
# surface (content-spark prerequisite, direction gate, S-4 approval, S-6 offer)
# adopts the grammar - that boundary is asserted with scoped block extraction.
# A paraphrase, a resurrected bare question stem, or a boundary leak should fail
# the suite, not slip through review.
