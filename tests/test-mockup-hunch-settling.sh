# test-mockup-hunch-settling.sh - Guard Story 8's locked strings across the spec files.
# Doc-level assertions that the hunch-settling design is specced as locked: the
# executable threshold, the five below-threshold signals, the throw-don't-interrogate
# move, the riff.md canonical pointer, the mockup funnel's silent settle gate, the
# Settled: recording rule, and the guard survivals (DO-NOT-SIMPLIFY + three-AUQ).
# Adjacent stories edit these same shared files; a paraphrased rule or a resurrected
# escalation path should fail the suite, not slip through review.
