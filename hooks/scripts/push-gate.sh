# push-gate.sh - PreToolUse gate for `git push` (plugin-shipped).
#
# Denies a push while either custody signal is live:
#   1. Untriaged leftovers - ledger entries with decision: pending. The deny
#      reason instructs the orchestrator to run the leftover triage and retry.
#   2. Secret-shaped paths in the outgoing range @{u}..HEAD, matched against
#      the shared deny-pattern list (secret-deny-patterns.sh).
#
# On a clean tree with a triaged ledger it stays SILENT - no allow, no deny.
# The gate only ever blocks; it never grants push approval. Combined with
# auto-approve-plugin-scripts.sh abstaining on git push, a clean push falls
# through to the user's own permission flow (prompt or their allowlist).
# Craft never decides that a push is approved - only the user does.
#
# Output is exit-0 JSON (hookSpecificOutput.permissionDecision) - NEVER
# exit 2, which can make the model stop instead of acting on the reason.
#
# Fails OPEN on every tooling gap: missing jq, missing helper scripts,
# unresolvable project root, no upstream (the secret scan is impossible
# without @{u} - documented boundary for local-only repos), or an
# unreadable/unparseable ledger. A custody gate that wedged every push on
# its own tooling would train users to bypass it.
