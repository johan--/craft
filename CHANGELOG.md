# Changelog

Notable, user-facing changes per version. Internal changes (tests, refactors, contributor tooling) bump the version without an entry, so version numbers here may skip.

## 1.99.39

- Added a deterministic first-move menu to /craft:init: every init now ends with the same three options (Mock up a screen / Describe a feature / I'll take it from here) instead of an open-ended prompt the model improvised around - the mockup option appears only for visual projects, and craft recommends a mockup on empty projects or a feature when code already exists
- Fixed Quick setup ending in its own improvised kickoff - both setup paths now land on the same first-move menu
- Added a greenfield floor for first stories: when a story is planned on a project with no runnable skeleton, its first chunk scaffolds the framework - and when the story came from a mockup, the approved mockup.html is ported in verbatim as the base route, so the design approved in the browser becomes the foundation instead of getting reinterpreted

## 1.99.38

- Added tokens.yaml merging to /craft:init: when a mockup (or you) already created tokens.yaml, init merges extracted values into it instead of skipping extraction or overwriting the file - your approved values always win by default, and same-key conflicts are listed per-key for you to resolve explicitly
- Added merge-tokens.py, a deterministic merge engine behind that behavior: it diffs extracted values against your file before you're asked anything, writes surgically (untouched lines and their provenance comments cannot change), backfills missing sections from template defaults, and verifies its own result - restoring your original file if anything is off
- Added a write-gate guard for tokens.yaml: whole-file rewrites of an existing tokens.yaml are blocked at the tool level with a pointer to the merge engine - targeted single-key updates and first-time creation are unaffected
- Fixed the project scanner counting a mockup's own HTML toward the visual-file count and reading design values from it - .craft/ is now excluded from scans
- Fixed setup preserving an existing tokens.yaml on CLI and hybrid projects instead of replacing it with the conventions template

## 1.99.37

- Added cold-start support to /craft:mockup: a project with real UI code runs the full mockup funnel without ever running /craft:init - records persist under the project's own .craft/mockups/, accepting solidify creates tokens.yaml from the values you approved, and all three destinations (tweak / story / park) work cold with a gentle init reminder instead of a forced setup
- Added an empty-folder route: /craft:mockup in a folder with no visual code hands off to /craft:init directly - init's inspiration session is where an empty project's taste is born
- Fixed the write gate wrongly arming itself in never-inited projects: a bare .craft/ left by a cold mockup no longer counts as a craft project root, so source edits stay unblocked
- Renamed the project-root resolver to find-workshop.sh - it answers "is there a craft workshop here?", and the mockup's cold path is literally its no

## 1.99.36

- Added stack-aware quality gates: craft fingerprints which toolchains your repo actually has (.NET, Go, Python, Rust, Make, and more) and every validation report carries one honest coverage line - "full coverage", or exactly which toolchain no gate measures
- Added the gate reconcile beat: when a chunk passes while a toolchain sits unmeasured, craft asks (a real question dialog) whether to wire a gate - it proposes a command as an editable draft, runs it once to prove it works, surfaces pre-existing failures with a non-blocking option, and writes it to quality.yaml with a verified stamp; declining is confirmed once with its risk spelled out, then that toolchain is never asked about again - it stays visible in the coverage row and /craft:status as "(declined)" so waived-by-choice never reads as missed-by-accident, and autonomous runs ask at launch (pre-flight) instead of mid-run so hands-off cycles never validate toolchains nobody agreed to leave unmeasured
- Changed quality.yaml command execution to the verified path: a gate command only runs once it carries a verified: stamp (hand-written stamps count), and a verified command that stops starting reports broken verification with a re-verify offer instead of failing your chunk
- Removed the orphaned run-gates.sh script and the template's dormant command fields - dead config that advertised customization the harness never read

## 1.99.35

- Added the Taste Pass: once several tweaks you loved have accrued, craft offers a "victory lap" that scouts other surfaces the same taste could spread to and hands each one to /craft:mockup to make - surfaced as one ignorable line at session start or a tweak close-out, never a popup, and self-silencing if you never take it
- Added taste lineage: a loved tweak that grows into a mockup and graduates into a story or another tweak now records where it came from, so a button that snowballs into a whole page still traces back to where the taste started
- Changed the tweak close-out to a feeling gradient (Love it / Looks good / Good enough / Not quite); "apply elsewhere" is now a follow-on offer instead of a button

## 1.99.34

- Improved mockup Diverge rounds: options are style-isolated (no more overlap between them), render at real scale, and at least one option must break past the project's current design language - safe-times-three now counts as a failed round

## 1.99.32

- Changed mockup rounds to edit the living page instead of regenerating it, and to verify handoffs with console/DOM checks - screenshots now happen only for viewports you can't see (mobile emulation, unattended sessions) or on request

## 1.99.31

- Changed the changelog to notable-only: features and user-visible fixes get entries, internal fixes bump the version silently

## 1.99.29

- Added /craft:mockup: a live HTML mockup funnel - a persistent alchemist builds 3 genuinely different options, you converge by reacting through diverge/refine/polish rounds, and new design values solidify to tokens.yaml at acceptance
- Added three graduation ramps for a converged mockup: port it now as a tweak, create a pre-filled story (mockup CSS is normative - ported, never reinterpreted), or park it as a notebook todo
- Added mockup visibility: a Mockups section in /craft:status and a session-start segment when mockups await a destination
- Changed story creation: the source question now also offers "From mockup" when converged mockup records exist

## 1.99.28

- Added this changelog: notable user-facing changes land here with every release, enforced by the doc-drift push gate
