## Statuses

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `draft` | Just an idea, not planned |
| `planning` | In creative mode, locking decisions |
| `ready` | Story file complete, can implement |
| `active` | Currently being implemented |
| `blocked` | Waiting on dependency |
| `complete` | 95% done, tests passing |
| `verified` | Human reviewed & approved |

## Parallelism

### Implementation Parallelism
- Max 2 stories in parallel, use `1a`, `1b` suffix
- Parallel stories must NOT touch same files

### Planning Parallelism
- `plan-chunks` skill supports batch mode: plans all `status: planning` stories in a cycle in parallel
- **Dual-mode orchestration:**
  - Agent teams (primary) — when `CLAUDE_CODE_EXPERIMENTAL_AGENT_TEAMS=1`. Teammates coordinate live (file overlap, dependency awareness)
  - Task subagents (fallback) — isolated agents with post-hoc cohesion check by orchestrator
- Batch size: determined by story dependency graph (topological levels — independent stories plan in parallel, dependent chains plan sequentially)
- Pattern: **skill as orchestrator + agents as workers** — plan-chunks orchestrates, plan-chunks-agent does the heavy lifting per story
- After agents complete → batch triage (BT-1 through BT-7) reviews all plans with user

## Workflow Formats

The workflow command supports two formats detected by checking for a `stages/` directory.

**Monolithic** — all stages in `definition.md`. Good for 3-5 stage workflows.

**stages-v1** — `definition.md` is a routing table; each stage is a self-contained file in `stages/`. Sessions get an `artifacts/` directory for cross-stage handoff. Stage files declare `consumes:` (artifact paths from prior stages) and `produces:` (output path). This is the preferred format for workflows with 6+ stages or substantial per-stage documentation.

Artifact handoff replaces relying on conversation memory across compaction boundaries. Stage 5 can reliably read Stage 1's output by declaring it in `consumes:` - the orchestrator reads the artifact file at dispatch time regardless of whether the original context is still present.

See `docs/workflow-reference.md` for the full format spec and examples.

## Human Checkpoints

- If ANYTHING weird → NO assumptions, ask human
- State snapshot before every chunk, one git commit at story completion
- Trust by default, verify when uncertain

---

## Modes Detail

### Chat Mode (`modes/chat.yaml`)

Write access restricted to `.craft/` and `.claude/` only. All creative and planning skills available. Used by Craftsman web chat agent and CLI sessions between stories.

**Included skills:** content-spark, creative-spark, design-vibe, lock-decision, plan-chunks, fix, approve, browser
**Included agents:** plan-chunks-agent, project-scanner, muse, alchemist, conductor, doc-writer, product-anthropologist, pr-reviewer-expert, maze-architect, researcher, verifier, practitioner-reviewer, playwright-browser, become-researcher, crystallizer
**Included commands:** craft, craft:init, craft:plan, craft:cycle-design, craft:cycle-start, craft:cycle-complete, craft:cycle-assign, craft:story-new, craft:story-archive, craft:story-delete, craft:status, craft:update-docs, craft:docs, craft:project, craft:review, craft:become, craft:ask, craft:workflow, craft:research, craft:research-verify, craft:fix

### Implement Mode (`modes/implement.yaml`)

Full write access, gated by `CRAFT_WRITE_ENABLED` in `.global-state`. Runs with `acceptEdits` permission mode. Max 100 turns. Auto-prompt: runs `/craft:story-implement-auto`.

**Allowed tools:** Read, Write, Edit, Glob, Grep, Bash, Task
**Included skills:** validate-chunk, refine-chunk, test-fix
**Included agents:** implementer, tester, chunk-validator
**Included commands:** craft:story-implement, craft:story-implement-auto, craft:story-continue

---

## Hooks Detail

All hooks defined in `hooks/hooks.json`. Scripts in `hooks/scripts/`.

### SessionStart
- **`session-start.sh`** (once) — Detects active cycle, sets status line, loads context
- **`post-compact-reinject.sh`** (on compact) — Re-injects craft context after context compaction

### PreToolUse (Write|Edit)
- **`check-write-permission.py`** — Enforces write permission gating. Checks mode (chat vs implement), CRAFT_WRITE_ENABLED flag, and allowed paths.

### PostToolUse (Write|Edit)
- **`update-progress.py`** (async) — Tracks which files were modified, updates story progress counts

### PostToolUseFailure
- **`handle-tool-failure.py`** (async) — Logs tool failures, appends to recovery log

### PreCompact
- **`export-progress.sh`** — Exports current progress state before context window compaction

### UserPromptSubmit
- **`inject-craft-context.sh`** — Injects active cycle/story context into every prompt

### Stop
- **`stop-hook-guard.sh`** — Guards against unclean session stops, ensures state consistency

|--------|---------|
| `create-checkpoint.sh` | Git stash-based rollback points before chunks |
| `create-cycle.sh` | Scaffold a new cycle directory |
| `create-story.sh` | Create story file from template |

CURRENT_WORKFLOW_SESSION=""
RUN_MODE=""
```

Key fields:
- `CRAFT_WRITE_ENABLED` — gates writes outside `.craft/`. Set to `"true"` by active stories, the `fix` skill, and the `approve` skill. Empty string means closed.
- `CURRENT_WORKFLOW_SESSION` — active workflow session path (set when a workflow session is running).

## Testing

Bash test suite in `tests/`. Run all tests:

```bash
./tests/run-all.sh
```

Individual tests follow the pattern `test-{script-name}.sh` and test the corresponding hook script. Tests use `test_helper.sh` for shared setup/teardown and fixtures from `tests/fixtures/`.
